        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tightly wrap the meatloaf in plastic wrap or aluminum foil (or place
            it in an airtight container). Store meatloaf in the refrigerator for
            three to four days.To freeze meatloaf, wrap it in at least one layer
            of storage wrap followed by at least one layer of foil. For extra
            protection, place the double-wrapped meatloaf in a zip-top freezer
            bag labeled with the date. Store meatloaf in the freezer for three
            to four months.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use an instant read thermometer, inserted into the middle, to check
            the doneness of the meatloaf. It's completely cooked and safe to eat
            at 160 degrees F.
