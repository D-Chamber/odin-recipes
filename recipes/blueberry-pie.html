        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            You can keep covered blueberry pie at room temperature for about two
            days. If you intend to keep the pie longer than that, you should
            keep it in the refrigerator. It will last there for up to five days.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you intend to freeze the pie, go ahead and bake it in a foil pan.
            Wrap the whole pan in storage wrap, then wrap it again in foil.
            Freeze for up to six months.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>1 (14.1 ounce) package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Set an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to
                375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl;
                sprinkle over blueberries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line a pie dish with one pie crust. Pour berry mixture into the
                crust and dot with butter. Cut remaining pastry into 1/2- to
                3/4-inch-wide strips. Use the strips to weave a lattice top.
                Crimp and flute the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake pie on the lowest oven rack until filling is bubbling and
                crust is golden brown, about 50 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
